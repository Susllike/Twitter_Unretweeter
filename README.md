# Twitter_Unretweeter

Twitter unretweeter - you can mass remove every retweet on your timeline in case you want to remove duplicates of your own content or others' content

Note #1: You need to have an existing Twitter API project, otherwise this code will not function; any API access will work (either v1.1 or v2)

Note #2: the config.ini file in this repo is simply a placeholder for you to put your own keys into from your Twitter API project; it does not contain anything from my own project for obvious security reasons.
